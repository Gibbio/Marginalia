# Marginalia — AI Agent Context

Marginalia is a local-first voice reading and annotation engine written in Rust.
It ingests text/markdown documents, chunks them, synthesizes speech via TTS, and
lets the user navigate, annotate, and interact with the content by voice.

## Architecture

Hexagonal architecture. Core has zero external dependencies — all I/O through traits (ports).

Key traits in `marginalia-core::ports`:
- `SpeechSynthesizer` — TTS (implemented by marginalia-tts-mlx and marginalia-tts-kokoro)
- `DocumentRepository`, `SessionRepository`, `NoteRepository` — storage
- `DocumentImporter` — file import
- `PlaybackEngine` — audio playback
- `CommandRecognizer`, `DictationTranscriber` — STT

The runtime (`marginalia-runtime`) composes everything. Apps create providers
and pass them to the runtime via `set_speech_synthesizer()`, etc.

## TTS — the critical path

TTS performance is the main UX constraint. Current backends:

| Crate | Backend | Platform | ~Latency (164ch) |
|---|---|---|---|
| marginalia-tts-mlx | Kokoro-82M via MLX Metal | macOS Apple Silicon | ~1000ms |
| marginalia-tts-kokoro | Kokoro-82M via ONNX Runtime | Cross-platform | ~5700ms |

`make tui-rs` auto-selects MLX on macOS arm64. Configuration in `apps/tui-rs/marginalia.toml`:

```toml
[mlx]
voice = "if_sara"    # Italian female (or im_nicola for male)
```

MLX deps come from:
- `Gibbio/voice-mlx` (GitHub) — forked voice-tts/voice-nn/voice-dsp with patched decoder
- `oxideai/mlx-rs` (GitHub, git HEAD) — Rust MLX bindings (must use git, not crates.io v0.25.3 which bundles old MLX C++)

### Async navigation + cache + prefetch

Three mechanisms work together to minimize latency:

1. **Async commands**: navigation commands (next/back/repeat etc.) run in a
   background thread so the UI never freezes during TTS synthesis.

2. **TTS cache**: synthesized chunks are cached by (document_id, section, chunk,
   voice). WAV files persist on disk in `.marginalia-tts-cache/`. Revisiting a
   chunk is instant.

3. **Background prefetch**: after a navigation command completes, a **separate**
   fire-and-forget thread pre-synthesizes the next chunk into the cache. The
   prefetch thread acquires the runtime lock only after the command thread
   releases it, so the UI stays responsive and playback starts immediately.

Result: first chunk ~1s, all subsequent chunks instant in sequential reading.

**IMPORTANT**: prefetch must NEVER run in the same thread as the current command.
A previous attempt did this and froze the UI for ~2s (current chunk + prefetch).
The fix was to spawn a separate `std::thread` from `poll_async_result` after
the command succeeds, not from `replay_session_at_position`.

## Phonemizer — misaki reference

The phonemizer in `marginalia-tts-mlx` replicates the behavior of
[misaki](https://github.com/hexgrad/misaki) (`misaki/espeak.py`), the official
G2P engine for Kokoro, written by the model author (hexgrad).

How it works:
1. **Normalize** text: `() [] {}` → commas, dashes → commas, smart quotes → ASCII
2. **Split** on clause punctuation (`. , ! ? : ;` and CJK equivalents)
3. **Phonemize** each clause via `espeak-ng --ipa`
4. **Re-insert** punctuation between phoneme clauses
5. **Clean** IPA output: remove tie chars (`^`), combining diacritics (U+0329, U+032A)

This is language-agnostic — works for any language espeak-ng supports.
Adding a new language requires zero source changes, just a new voice in the toml.

**Reference source**: `hexgrad/misaki/misaki/espeak.py` — `EspeakG2P.__call__`
and `EspeakFallback.__call__`. When in doubt about phonemizer behavior, check
misaki first. It is the canonical reference for how Kokoro expects phonemes.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release                    # default (no native deps)
cargo build --release -p marginalia-tui --features mlx-tts   # with MLX TTS
make tui-rs                              # auto-detects platform
cargo test                               # all tests
```

Building marginalia-tts-mlx requires Xcode + Metal Toolchain on macOS.

## Key conventions

- Italian is the primary language (documents, TTS voices, STT commands)
- Chunk target: ~300 characters per chunk
- Audio: 24kHz sample rate (Kokoro), 22050Hz (Piper)
- Config: TOML (`apps/tui-rs/marginalia.toml`)
- Default voice: `af_bella` (English), `if_sara` / `im_nicola` (Italian)
- espeak-ng is used as external phonemizer (all languages, clause-by-clause)
- Phonemizer rules follow misaki (hexgrad/misaki) — the Kokoro reference G2P

## What NOT to do

- Don't add Python dependencies to the main codebase
- Don't use CoreML EP with Kokoro (dynamic shapes → deadlock/crash)
- Don't use mlx-rs from crates.io (v0.25.3 bundles MLX C++ 0.25, too slow)
- Don't make TTS calls synchronous in the UI thread
- Don't add unnecessary abstractions — three similar lines > premature abstraction
- Don't invent phonemizer rules — check misaki (hexgrad/misaki) first
- Don't call espeak-ng on full text (strips punctuation) — call per clause
